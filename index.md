## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Nate Jennewein, and I am a junior mechanical engineering student at Cornell University. I am passionate about many aspects of engineering, but currently I am hoping to focus on either surgical or body scale biomechanics for athletes, as I am also a member of Cornell's Division 1 baseball team. 

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
